# Efficient Coding Sample Completion

This repository showcases an efficiently completed coding sample for AsureQuality's hiring process coding test. The project demonstrates the use of React and Material UI for the frontend, as well as Express for the backend with MongoDB.

## Features

The coding sample focuses on the core functionality of a todo list application. While the scope was limited, I implemented the following features:

- **Todo List**: The application allows users to create, view, and manage their todo items.
- **Complete Toggle**: Users can mark items as complete or incomplete by simply clicking on them.
- **Deletion**: Users can delete items they no longer need.
- **Responsive UI**: The user interface is designed to adapt to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main folders:

- `client`: Contains the frontend code built with React and Material UI.
- `server`: Contains the backend code built with Express.

## Steps Taken

Here's an overview of the steps I took to efficiently complete the coding sample:

1. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Created a new React project using Create React App (from React scripts) to quickly set up the frontend.
   - Integrated Material UI components to bootstrap the user interface efficiently.

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Leveraged a previous Express project I had as a base to kickstart the backend development.
   - Configured the necessary routes and controllers for the todo list functionality.

3. **Core Functionality:**
   - Implemented the core functionality of the todo list, including adding new items, marking items as complete, and deleting items.

4. **Refinement and Testing:**
   - Polished the user interface, ensuring a clean and intuitive design.
   - Conducted thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

Please note that while the coding sample demonstrates the core functionality of a todo list, additional features such as user authentication, shared lists, and extended item editing were not included due to the limited scope of the coding test.

## Getting Started

To run the coding sample locally, follow these steps:

1. **Client Setup:**

   - Navigate to the `client` folder.
   - Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
   - Run `npm start` to start the client.

2. **Server Setup:**

   - Navigate to the `server` folder.
   - Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
   - Make sure to configure the `.env` file properly before starting the server.
   - Set up a MongoDB server to connect to.
   - Run `npm start` to start the server.

Thank you for considering my coding sample!
